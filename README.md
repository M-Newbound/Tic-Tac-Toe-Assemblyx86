# Assembly Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, written in assembly language.

## How to Run

To assemble and run the game, use the following commands on the Linux operating system:

``` bash
make
./build/tic_tac_toe
```

## Game Rules

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell of the grid with their symbol (X or O). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner. If all cells are filled and there's no winner, the game is a draw.

A player must enter their target square using row (0-2) and column (0-2) indices. For example, "12" represents row 1, column 2.

## Why I Undertook This Project
### Interest in Lower-Level Programming

I have a strong interest in lower-level programming, which allows me to understand the fundamental operations of a computer. Assembly language provides a unique perspective on how high-level code translates to machine instructions, giving me insights that are often abstracted away in higher-level languages.

### Unique Challenges

Working with assembly language presents unique challenges, such as managing registers, understanding memory addressing, and optimizing performance. These challenges have helped me grow as a programmer and improve my problem-solving skills.

## What I Learned
### Different Mindset of Programming

Programming in assembly requires a different mindset compared to high-level languages. It demands a thorough understanding of the hardware and meticulous attention to detail. This experience has honed my ability to think critically about how code executes at the hardware level.

### Deeper Understanding of Computer Architecture

This project gave me a deeper understanding of computer architecture. I gained hands-on experience with concepts such as instruction sets, registers, and memory management, which are crucial for understanding how computers actually run code.

### Inner Workings of Code Execution

By working with assembly, I learned more about the inner workings of how computers execute code. This knowledge is invaluable for optimizing programs and understanding the performance implications of different coding approaches.

## If I were to undertake this project again, I would:

- **Improve User Interface**: Enhance the user interface to make the game more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **Add More Features**: Introduce additional features such as player statistics, difficulty levels, and a computer opponent.
- **Optimize Code**: Further optimize the code for performance and efficiency, exploring advanced assembly techniques and instructions.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the game runs on multiple operating systems, not just Linux.
